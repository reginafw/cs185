			One of Paris's most charming, mythical and quirky places to wander, the Montmartre neighborhood crowns the city, situated in its hilly northern heights. It oozes poetry and charm: come here for winding cobblestone paths, ivy hanging from wooden window panes, views of the majestic Sacre Coeur from cafe windows and myriad local shops selling cured meets or delicious pastries and breads. All this, and much more, awaits you in this legendary district, which manages to retain charm and authenticity in spite of being quite touristy in certain corners. 

			Shop for quirky, handmade clothes and jewelry, visit museums or simply brave the snaking, often precipitously hilly streets until you reach the top.

			Once at the summit, you can enjoy spectacular panoramic views of Paris: these make the thigh-busting walk up the hill completely worth it. Of course, if you prefer to take the funicular at some point up to the very top, no one will fault you!
