				Hi! I'm Regina (Pronouns: she/her/hers), a third year CS major. This is my first time tutoring a CS class, so we can both learn a lot form each other! I'm excited for CS16 this quarter because unlike Fall and Winter Quarter, students with a diversity of backgrounds from different majors take the class. Whether you're taking this class for your major, or just for fun, I hope that after this quarter you get better idea of what computer science is and feel more confident about coding in C++! As a tutor, I hope that I can help you develop skills like debugging, critical thinking when it comes to coding, and feeling more comfortable using software development tools. As a woman in CS, I have definitely felt imposter syndrome and lack of confidence in my major, and remember feeling intimidated by Computer Science. I found that making connections with other students in CS, whether joining a campus engineering organization, or getting to know my tutors, really helped. I still go to tutor office hours for classes I take to this day, so don't hesitate to go! Outside of school my interests include backpacking, board games, staying active in my engineering sorority, and trying out new recipes. If you have any questions or want advice about classes, the major, or anything feel free to reach out to me on Piazza!
